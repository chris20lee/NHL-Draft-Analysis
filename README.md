# NHL-Draft-Analysis
Analysis of the NHL Entry Draft for odds of selecting an NHL player with respect to draft rounds and draft positions.

Given the importance of young players in the salary cap era in the NHL, increased emphasis is place on the yearly NHL Entry Draft as this is major route for teams to find and develop young talent for their teams. For this analysis  I look at the odds of finding an NHL player from the draft given their draft positions. An NHL player is defined as a player that has played over 82 games in their career to date. 

I chose draft classes from the year 2000 to the year 2016 for the analysis. These are the years in which there were 30 teams in the NHL so each round in the draft would have 30 players picked. The end year was chosen at 2016 because more draft classes would have players who haven't had a chance to make it in the NHL.

The results from this analysis are what one's qualitative intutions might suspect, players drafted earlier have a better chance of turing into NHL players. This is evident in the draft round breakdown and draft position breakdown. What this analysis adds is the quantitative evidence to back up the qualitative intutions regarding the NHL Entry Draft.
